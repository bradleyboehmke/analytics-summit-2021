# Analytics Summit 2021 Presentation

**Title**: Scaling Productivity with an Inner Source Ecosystem

**Abstract**: The open source ecosystem provides many resources that most organizations leverage and benefit from. The beauty of this ecosystem is that many packages and tools exist to make you more effective and efficient; plus, you have the opportunity to contribute back to the source code. At 84.51Â° we have started to create our own inner source ecosystem of internal packages and tools to help make our 250+ data scientists more productive. This talk will discuss how we did it, the benefits and challenges, along with providing tips that you can take back to your organization to start building similar capabilities.
